# Serverless Gemini Discord Bot for Vercel

## ðŸ”´ ACTION REQUIRED: How to Fix a Crashing Bot
---

You have indicated that the **"Serverless Function has crashed"**. This is the key to solving the problem.

This error happens for one primary reason: **Your Environment Variables are incorrect or missing in your Vercel project settings.**

The bot's code tries to start up, but it can't find the API keys it needs, so it immediately crashes.

### âœ… **Follow These Steps Exactly To Fix It**

1.  Go to your project on the **Vercel Dashboard**.
2.  Click the **Settings** tab.
3.  Click on **Environment Variables** in the side menu.
4.  You **must** have all four of the following variables set up. Check them for typos. Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters.

    - `DISCORD_TOKEN`
    - `CLIENT_ID`
    - `PUBLIC_KEY`
    - `GEMINI_API_KEY`

5.  After you have confirmed all four variables are set correctly, you **must re-deploy** your application. Go to the "Deployments" tab on Vercel, click the "..." menu on your latest deployment, and select "Redeploy".

This will solve the crash. Once the function is running, Discord will be able to verify the endpoint URL.

### Bot Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: Built to deploy on Vercel's free hobby plan.
- **Gemini-Powered Responses**: Uses the `gemini-1.5-flash` model to generate witty and in-character responses.
- **Slash Commands**: All interactions are through slash commands.
  - `/chat [message]`: Chat with the bot.
  - `/setup`: (Admin-only) Restricts the bot to operate in the channel where the command is used.
- **Persistent Configuration**: The `/setup` command's channel preference is stored in Vercel KV, a serverless Redis database.

### Full Setup and Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to get your own instance of the bot running.

#### 1. Get Your Credentials

You will need to gather the following secrets and IDs:

- **Discord Bot Token**: Go to your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a new application, and go to the "Bot" tab. Click "Reset Token" to get your token.
- **Discord Client ID**: On the "General Information" page of your application, you'll find the `APPLICATION ID`. This is your Client ID.
- **Discord Public Key**: Also on the "General Information" page, you'll find the `PUBLIC KEY`.
- **Gemini API Key**: Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and create a new API key.
- **Vercel KV Store**: You'll set this up during the Vercel deployment.

#### 2. Local Configuration (for running commands)

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and fill in the values you gathered in Step 1.

#### 3. Register Slash Commands

Before deploying, you need to tell Discord about your bot's commands. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run register
```

You should see a success message confirming the commands were registered. You only need to do this once.

#### 4. Deploy to Vercel

1.  **Create a Vercel Project**: Go to your Vercel dashboard and create a new project, linking it to your forked/cloned GitHub repository.
2.  **Configure Environment Variables**: In the project settings on Vercel, navigate to "Environment Variables". Add the `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, `PUBLIC_KEY`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY` with the same values from your `.env` file. **THIS IS THE MOST COMMON POINT OF FAILURE.**
3.  **Set up Vercel KV**:
    - Go to the "Storage" tab in your Vercel project.
    - Create a new KV (Redis) database.
    - Connect it to your project. Vercel will automatically add the necessary `KV_*` environment variables.
4.  **Deploy**: Trigger a deployment from the Vercel dashboard.
5.  **Set the Interactions Endpoint URL**:
    - Once deployed, Vercel will give you a URL (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`).
    - Go back to your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select your application.
    - In the "General Information" page, paste your Vercel deployment URL into the **INTERACTIONS ENDPOINT URL** field. Make sure to append `/api/interactions`. For example: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app/api/interactions`.
    - Click "Save Changes".

Your bot should now be online and responding to the `/chat` and `/setup` commands in your Discord server! You must invite the bot to your server from the "OAuth2" -> "URL Generator" page in the Discord Developer Portal, selecting the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes.
